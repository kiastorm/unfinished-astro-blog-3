I've spent more time than I'm willing to admit investigating the source code of popular and much-loved React UI libraries like [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) and [Radix UI](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes), and architecting similar systems myself.

I'm currently working on [SingleStore](https://singlestore.com)'s design system, Fusion, where we're focused on auditting our applications and implementing a design system that's shared across all three of the major applications - the [Product](https://www.singlestore.com/cloud-trial/), [Docs](https://www.docs.singlestore.com/) and [Marketing](https://singlestore.com) websites.

[Inspired by a tweet I saw](https://twitter.com/ianvieira_/status/1697960844376584700), I decided to share what I've learned about building reusable UI components in React.

## 1. Give consumers control over the rendering logic

Put simply: export each HTML element that your component renders as a separate React component.

```
// Bad
<Tags items={[{ label: "React" }, { label: "UI" }, { label: "CSS" }, { label: "Design Systems" },]}>

// Good
<TagGroup>
  <Tag>
		React
	</Tag>
	<Tag>
		UI
	</Tag>
	<Tag>
		CSS
	</Tag>
	<Tag>
		Design Systems
	</Tag>
</TagGroup>
```

At the very least, allow consumers to replace any HTML element via a prop.
